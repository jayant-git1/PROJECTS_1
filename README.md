Hand Tracking with OpenCV and Python
This project demonstrates a real-time hand tracking system using Python's OpenCV library and the cvzone.HandTrackingModule. It utilizes a webcam feed to detect and analyze hand landmarks, identify finger states (up or down), and measure distances between key points or between two hands.

🚀 Features:
Real-time hand detection using webcam input

Detection of up to 2 hands simultaneously

Finger state detection (which fingers are raised)

Distance measurement between fingertips or hand centers

Visual output with bounding boxes, landmark points, and distance overlays

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python

OpenCV

cvzone

Mediapipe (used indirectly via cvzone)

📌 Use Cases:
Gesture recognition

Sign language detection (basic groundwork)

Interactive computer vision applications

Human-computer interaction (HCI) experiments
